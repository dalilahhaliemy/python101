'''
- usual decimal system has base of 10 (0,1,2...,9)
- say we wanna convert them to a binary format which has base of 2 (0,1) BIT number (BInary digiT)
- other number system are
i) octal system (0-7)
ii) HexaDecimal system (0-9, abcdef) ipv6 use this

# converting a number (decimal system) to a binary format

print(bin(25))      # convert 25 in binary format
                    # 0b is to indicate it is in the binary system. the value is after b

print(0b0101)       # convert 0101 in binary format to decimal number

print(oct(25))      # convert 25 in octal format
print(0o31)
print(hex(25))      # convert 25 in hexadecimal format
print(0x19)
print(0xf)          # f is 15 in hexadecimal
